Agenda:

1. Set up the GitHub Repository:
   - Create a new repository on GitHub.
   - Clone the repository to your local machine using Git.

2. Set up a new environment:
   - Open a command terminal.
   - Create a new virtual environment using Conda: `conda create -n venv python=3.8 -y`.
   - Activate the virtual environment: `conda activate venv/`.
  

3. Project Structure:
  - Create a setup.py and requirements.txt folder.
    `pip install -r requirements.txt`
   - Create an "src" folder and add an `__init__.py` file to each folder.
   - Create a "components" folder:
     - Inside the "components" folder, create the following files:
       - `data_ingestion.py`
       - `data_transformation.py`
       - `model_trainer.py`
   - Create a "pipeline" folder:
     - Inside the "pipeline" folder, create the following files:
       - `predict_pipeline.py`
       - `train_pipeline.py`
    -Create a file for exception handling , exception.py, logger.py
    -Create all the clients, or cloud in utils.py

4. EDA nad model training
Add data and ipynb file in notebook folder
a. run the cells to perform EDA on data
do pip install ipykernel to get jupyter notebook in vs code

5. Data Ingestion Code needs to be created where the train and test data split happens and saved in different files


Regarding the error I encountered:

1 The error message "No .egg-info directory found" suggests that there may be an issue with the package you're trying to install or the metadata specified in the setup.py file. 
  a. Ensure that the package is available and the setup.py file is correctly defined.
  b. Go to File -> Save All to save the venv environment that was created
